  - `packaging/` — PacNixum package manager and related scripts
  - `system/` — System integration, installer, and configuration
  - `tools/` — Custom utilities and helper scripts
  - `branding/` — Logos, wallpapers, and visual assets
  - `tests/` — Automated tests and QA resources
  - `ci/` — Continuous integration and build scripts

## 3. Create Categorized Folders in Workspace
- Set up the above folder structure in the repository to keep all components organized and maintainable.

## 4. Document Plan and Structure in README
- Update the `README.md` to reflect the project structure and provide guidance for contributors.
