# ScrapeC Performance Optimization

ScrapeC is designed for high performance. Optimization strategies include:
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Efficient memory management
- Inlining and dead code elimination
- Fast code generation (C/LLVM IR)
- Concurrency and parallelism

Performance benchmarks and tuning guides will be added as the language matures.
