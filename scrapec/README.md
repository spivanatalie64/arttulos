# Why ScrapeC?

ScrapeC is a new systems programming language designed for ArttulOS and PacNixum. It combines the performance, low-level control, and portability of C with the safety, concurrency, and modern tooling of Rust.

## Key Benefits
- **Performance:** As fast as C, with zero-cost abstractions.
- **Memory Safety:** Borrow checker and ownership model inspired by Rust, preventing common bugs like use-after-free and buffer overflows.
- **Interoperability:** Can call C libraries directly and be embedded in C or Rust projects.
- **Modern Syntax:** Clean, expressive, and easy to learn for C and Rust developers.
- **Concurrency:** Built-in support for safe, efficient multithreading.
- **Tooling:** Modern build system, package manager, and language server support.

ScrapeC is the ideal language for building secure, high-performance, and maintainable system tools for ArttulOS.
