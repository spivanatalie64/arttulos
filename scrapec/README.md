# ScrapeC Language

ScrapeC is a modern systems programming language combining the best of C and Rust, designed for ArttulOS and PacNixum. It features strong typing, FFI, async, macros, and binary compatibility with C/Rust.

## Features
- Modern syntax, type inference, and ownership
- FFI with C and Rust
- Async, macros, smart pointers, pattern matching
- Minimal runtime and standard library
- Language server, package manager, and test suite

See `scrapec/SPEC.md` and `scrapec/ROADMAP.md` for details.

# Why ScrapeC?

ScrapeC is a new systems programming language designed for ArttulOS and PacNixum. It combines the performance, low-level control, and portability of C with the safety, concurrency, and modern tooling of Rust.

## Key Benefits
- **Performance:** As fast as C, with zero-cost abstractions.
- **Memory Safety:** Borrow checker and ownership model inspired by Rust, preventing common bugs like use-after-free and buffer overflows.
- **Interoperability:** Can call C libraries directly and be embedded in C or Rust projects.
- **Modern Syntax:** Clean, expressive, and easy to learn for C and Rust developers.
- **Concurrency:** Built-in support for safe, efficient multithreading.
- **Tooling:** Modern build system, package manager, and language server support.

ScrapeC is the ideal language for building secure, high-performance, and maintainable system tools for ArttulOS.
