# ArttulOS Mission Statement

ArttulOS exists to bring the power, stability, and security of RHEL and RHEL-compatible Linux to the end consumer, without the complexity or barriers of traditional enterprise distributions. Built around the Cinnamon desktop environment, our mission is to:

By bridging the gap between enterprise-grade technology and the needs of everyday users, ArttulOS brings the best of the enterprise world—robustness, security, and reliability—directly to the average consumer, without compromise.

- Deliver a high-integrity, reproducible, and secure Linux platform that is fully binary-compatible with RHEL and its ecosystem.
- Provide a user experience that is approachable, high-performance, and visually distinct—combining brutalist clarity with enterprise reliability—by defaulting to the Cinnamon desktop environment for a modern, familiar, and customizable interface.
- Empower users with the PacNixum package manager, merging the best of Nix (atomicity), Pacman (speed), and YUM (compatibility) in a single, unified tool.
- Maintain a transparent, community-driven development process, with a focus on security, system integrity, and continuous improvement.
- Make advanced Linux technology accessible to everyone, from home users to power users, while upholding the highest standards of open source freedom and trust.
